 * In our context, that should be suffient, since
 * anonymous-communication will not add nested structures.
 * The only nested structure is the payload, which means the
 * message creator will be responsible for the ordering.
 *
 * Should that become a burden, we could extend this function
 * to recursively sort the object keys.
